Mariana "Lali" Espósito (born 10 October 1991), who records as Lali, is an Argentine actress, singer, dancer, model, and songwriter.<br>
Espósito began her career as an actress and singer in 2003 when she joined the cast of the children's telenovela Rincón de Luz,<br>
created by producer Cris Morena. She had other subsequent supporting roles in telenovelas Chiquititas and<br>
Floricienta and a main role in Casi Ángeles, the latter of which increased her fame in Latin America, the Middle East, and Europe.<br>
From 2007 to 2012, Espósito, along with four other cast members from Casi Ángeles, was part of the teen pop band Teen Angels,<br>
which originated from the series. The group was commercially successful internationally,<br>
and toured throughout Argentina and countries such as Israel, Spain, Italy and Latin America.<br>
Espósito also sang in the soundtracks of Rincón de Luz and Chiquititas.<br>
Following her role in the unsuccessful 2011 telenovela Cuando me sonreís and her portrayal of Abigail<br>
Williams in the Buenos Aires production of The Crucible, Espósito made her film debut in La pelea de mi vida in 2012,<br>
starring alongside Mariano Martínez and Federico Amador.<br>
In January 2013, she began acting in the television comedy Solamente Vos, as the daughter of Adrián Suar's character.<br>
In 2015, Espósito portrayed her first lead role on TV as "Esperanza" on Esperanza mía. Its soundtrack album,<br>
in which she appeared on nine of the eleven tracks, received a platinum certification in Argentina for selling over 40,000 copies.<br>
Her debut solo studio album, A Bailar, was released on 21 March 2014, featuring pop and EDM influences.<br>
"A Bailar" was released as the lead single of the homonymous album.<br>
The album spawned the singles "Asesina", "Mil Años Luz", "Del Otro Lado" and "Histeria".<br>
The album peaked at No. 5 in Argentina and at No. 3 in Uruguay. In 2016, she released her second<br>
studio album Soy after the previous release of the songs "Unico" and "Soy".<br>
Both albums were certified gold in Argentina by the Argentine Chamber of Phonograms and Videograms Producers (CAPIF).<br>
Espósito's accolades include two Gardel Awards, one MTV Europe Music Award, one Kids' Choice Award,<br>
nine Argentine Kids' Choice Awards, four MTV Millennial Awards, one Tato Award, and<br>
nominations for the Martin Fierro Awards and the Seoul International Drama Awards.<br>
In 2015, Infobae named Espósito one of the 10 most influential women in Argentina.<br>
